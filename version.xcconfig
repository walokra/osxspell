// Launch Service compatible build versions. LS recognizes the format nnnnn.nn.nn.
// Restrict each revision number in your marketing version to be from 0 to 99,
// Encode the "major.minor.bug stage release", to a format of "MM.mm.bb s rr".
// Assign each development stage a number,
// 0 = development, 1 = alpha, 2 = beta, 3 = release candidate, 9 = released.
// Encode this as LS-compatible: "MMmmb.bs.rr".
// Thus a marketing version of "1.3.10b4" has an encoded build version of "01031.02.04".
// And "2.0.1" has an encoded version of "02000.19.00".
